# OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System)

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring the core concepts and principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the fundamentals or an experienced developer aiming to reinforce your understanding, this repository provides a comprehensive guide to OOP with practical examples and explanations.

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. Objects are instances of classes, which can hold both data (attributes) and methods (functions or procedures). OOP aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc., in programming. The main goal of OOP is to increase the flexibility and maintainability of code.

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Encapsulation:**
   - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It also refers to the restriction of access to certain components, preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class. The derived class inherits all the properties and behaviors (methods) of the base class and can also have additional features. Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It mainly occurs in two forms: compile-time (method overloading) and run-time (method overriding). Polymorphism is essential for implementing flexibility and integrating new features without altering existing code.

4. **Abstraction:**
   - Abstraction refers to the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort by providing a clear separation between what an object does and how it does it.
